# Simplified Deep Reinforcement Learning from Human Preferences (by Daniel Eid)

The project implements a simplified version of the paper "Deep Reinforcement Learning from Human Preferences" by Christiano et al. The paper introduces a method for training reinforcement learning agents using human feedback. The method is based on the idea of learning a reward function from human feedback and then using this reward function to train a reinforcement learning agent. The contribution of Daniel Eid implements a simplified version of the method and applies it to the discrete action space including up, down, left, right.
